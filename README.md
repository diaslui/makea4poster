# MakeA4Poster

This website will be useful if you need to make a large poster but can only print on A4, A3, A2, or A1 sheets. Print your image in several parts and assemble them like a jigsaw puzzle. You can choose the paper size and the overlap between sheets.

* The problem: You have a large image that you want to print as a poster, but your printer only supports A4, A3, A2, or A1 paper sizes.

* The solution: This website allows you to upload your image, select the desired paper size and overlap, and then generates a PDF file that you can print on multiple sheets of paper. You can then cut and assemble the printed sheets to create your large poster.
